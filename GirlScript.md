# Hi folks. Best way to contribute is to follow these steps.
1. Watch the video
2. Checkout the issues
3. Comment under the issues you would like to take up.
4. If you find a bug or want to propose a feature, create your own issues under the project.
5. Fork the repo. Create a branch dedicated to ur change for eg. 'readme-fix-aditi' is a branch with changes in the readme by some participant named aditi. Do not send the pull requests until March 1 as evaluation period starts then.

## There are two fronts of this project:
A. Implicit Matrix Factorisation : stuff machine learning participants will work on as the end goal of this project. The first phase of implementations will be in Python using necessary libraries and APIs while in the second phase we decide on how to integrate this model into the app (based on we choose to use online learning or offline). 
B. Creating a flutter clone of the Spotify App: a UI mimicking clone of the app using Flutter (main goal for Flutter participants) exploiting the ease of designing UI on flutter (this is an issue already), with OAuth capabilities (another issue).Both Teams will work towards creating an app where this recommendation system can work.
